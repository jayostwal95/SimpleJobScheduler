Project Title :
To implement a simple job scheduler that executes non-interactive jobs (e.g., jobs that do not have direct user interaction,  
jobs that can run in the background). 

Project Description :
In this project we will implement a simple job scheduler that will execute non-interactive jobs 
(for example, jobs that do not have direct user interaction,  jobs that can run in the background). 
At any given time only P jobs should be executing and P is provided as an argument to your program. If you have more than P jobs
 submitted, then these additional jobs must wait until one of the P executing jobs are completed.

Acknowledgement:
I would like to express my special thanks of gratitude to my Professor Purushottam Bangalore who gave me the golden
opportunity to do this wonderful project on implementing a shell or command prompt interpreter, which also helped
me in doing a lot of Research and i came to know about so many new things I am really thankful to them.
Secondly i would also like to thank the TA Trupesh Patel who is very helpful and responsive to every doubts asked
which made me understand the concepts and hence helped me finish the project within the given deadline.

Getting Started :

a. Pre-requisites :
It is mandatory to have a machine which has linux operating system or the windows system. Also, if the project does 
not get executed in the command prompt for any reason, then it is important to have putty software which can help
to run and execute the program on the server.

b.Instructions for building the software :
Since this project is not a fully fledged softwre, it is mandatory to have the linux and the windows operating 
system to make it operate.

Running the project :
To compile the project, you can use the command prompt or the linux shell and type the command,

gcc Project4.c queue.c -lpthread

To run the project, you can type the command,
./a.out [argument]
